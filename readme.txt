-------------Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the way of identifying sentiments and opinions in
tweets. The main computational steps in this process are determining the sentiment of the tweet and then categorizing them into the positive tweet or neutral tweets or negative tweet. The primary issue with Twitter sentiment analysis is the identification of the most suitable sentiment classifier that can correctly classify the tweets. Generally, base classification technique like Naive Bayes classifier, Random Forest classifier, SVMs and Logistic Regression are being used. The results show that the proposed ensemble classifier performs better than stand-alone classifiers and majority voting ensemble classifier. In addition, the role of data pre-processing and feature representation in sentiment classification technique is also explored as part of this work.

We have used Naive Bayes Classifier for analysing.


A Python code to classify the sentiment of a tweets to positive,negative or neutral.

For implmenting Sentiment Analysis we have used the training dataset called "Airline-Sentiment-2-w-AA.csv". 

----------------This folder contains two sub directories:

Source
Datasets
Test_Cases

Source contains the source code along with the dataset that the code uses.

Datasets contains few datasets that were used while writing the code.

Test_Cases contains few test cases for which the input was tested.


-----------------WAY TO USE THIS CODE:
1.) Download the jupyter file.
2.) Download the trainng Dataset and Stop words file.
3.) Place them at the same location.
4.) (ua2.csv) file is empty.
5.) In code change the name of (ua1.csv) file to (ua2.csv).
6.) After running the first Instruction.
7.) UI will open, In that Enter the keyword and close that new window for which you want sentiment analysis.
8.) After running the second instruction tweets will get extracted and check (ua2.csv) file all the tweets will get append in that file.
9.) After that run all the instructions, at last new UI will open.
10.) Last UI will contains the graphs which shows the sentiment analysis of the keyword which you have entered.
